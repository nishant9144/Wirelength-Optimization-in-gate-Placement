# Wirelength-Optimization-in-gate-Placement
## Problem
Given:
- a set of rectangular logic gates g1, g2...gn
- width and height of each gate gi
-the input and output pin locations (x and y co-ordinates) on the boundary of each gate gi
.p1, gi
.p2, ..., gi
.pm
(where gate gi has m pins)
- the pin-level connections between the gates
<br> 

Write a program to assign locations to all gates in a plane so that:
- no two gates are overlapping
- the sum of estimated wire lengths for all wires in the whole circuit is minimised.

## Constraint
- Assume that the gates cannot be re-oriented (rotated, etc.) in any way.
- Assuming that all wiring is horizontal and vertical
- Possible estimate for the wire length for a set of connected pins uses the semi-perimeter method: form
a rectangular bounding box of all the pin locations; the estimated wire length is half the perimeter of this
rectangle
<br>

Following are the input constraints:
- Corners of gate have integral coordinates
- Pins will have integral coordinates relative to the corresponding gate
- 0 < Number of gates ≤ 1000
- 0 < Width of gate ≤ 100
- 0 < Height of gate ≤ 100
- 0 < Number of pins on one side of a gate ≤ Height of Gate
- 0 < Total Number of pins ≤ 40000
- There is atleast 1 wire connecting a gate
## Solution
For our solution, we have combined two algorithms.<br>
First, we have used our algorithm used in software assignment 1 which is the Skyline
Algorithm.<br>
- We went for a heuristic method for packing rectangles onto a sheet using a
rectilinear skyline representation. This skyline is depicted as a sequence of
horizontal line segments that form the contour of vertical bars.<br>
The key properties of the skyline are:

- Consecutive segments have different y-coordinates.
- The x-coordinate of the right endpoint of each segment aligns with the xcoordinate of the left endpoint of the next.
- Initially, the skyline is a single segment representing the bottom of the sheet.

Rectangles are placed one by one, either with their bottom left corner touching a left
endpoint or their bottom right corner touching a right endpoint of a skyline segment.

The placement is determined by whether adjacent segments are higher or lower.
After placing a rectangle, the skyline is updated in two steps:
- A new segment is created for the top edge of the rectangle, and affected
segments are adjusted based on the rectangle's width.
- The algorithm identifies locally lowest segments—those lower than their
neighbors—and raises and merges them if no unplaced rectangles can fit.
This process continues until all segments are checked.

Second, we went for Simulated Annealing algorithm.<br>
Simulated Algorithm explores the solution space by randomly accepting worse
solutions with a probability based on temperature, which gradually decreases,
ensuring the system settles into an optimal or near-optimal solution.<br>
Steps of the Algorithm:
1. **Initial Solution**: Start with a random or heuristic-based layout of gates.
2. **Cost Function**: The cost function combines:
    - Wire length: The total Manhattan distance between connected gates.
    - Penalties: Applied for overlapping gates or boundary violations.
Cost = Wire Length + Penalty
3. **Neighbor Solution**: A new layout is generated by making small changes
(moving a gate) to the current solution.
4. **Acceptance Probability**: Even if the new solution is worse, it may still be
accepted based on a probability that decreases with temperature:<br>
<div style="text-align: center;">
P = exp(−ΔCost / T)</div>

5. **Cooling Schedule**: The temperature decreases over time, allowing for more
exploration early on and more refinement later. The cooling schedule is
divided into phases:
    - Stochastic Search: Early acceptance of worse solutions to explore the
solution space.
    - Local Search: Focus on improving the current solution.
    - Uphill Search: Periodic temperature increases to escape local minima.
6. **Termination**: The process continues until the temperature reaches a
minimum value, resulting in an optimized gate layout.
